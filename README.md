# Poker Texas Hold'em No Limit

Poker Texas Hold'em No Limit is the most popular variant of poker, requiring a minimum of two players and typically up to ten. 
It uses a standard deck of 52 cards, featuring ranks 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace in four suits: clubs, hearts, diamonds, and spades. 
The suits have equal value. The Jack, Queen, and King are valued as 11, 12, and 13, respectively, and the Ace can be worth either 1 or 14.

## Gameplay

Players compete to form the best hand while betting against each other over four stages. In no limit, bets are only restricted by players' chip counts. Community cards are dealt face up and can be used by all players. In each betting round, players can:

  - Fold: Forfeit their cards and exit the round.
  - Call: Match the current highest bet.
  - Raise: Increase the current bet.

### Turn Order

A white button marks the dealer's position, moving one spot left each round. This ensures all players experience different positions relative to the dealer. Action moves clockwise, starting from the first player left of the dealer.
#### First Round (Pre-flop)

Before play begins, the two players left of the dealer post blinds: the small blind and the big blind. Each player then receives two private cards, and the first betting round starts.
#### Second Round (Flop)

Three community cards are dealt face up, followed by the second betting round.
#### Third Round (Turn)

A fourth community card is dealt face up, followed by the third betting round.
#### Fourth Round (River)

A fifth community card is dealt face up, followed by the final betting round. If multiple players remain, a showdown occurs, and the player with the best hand wins the pot. If all but one player fold, the remaining player wins without revealing their cards.
